        From financial institutions to healthcare providers, every organization
        faces the challenge of keeping customer information safe while complying
        with strict privacy regulations. Our technology uses advanced AI models
        to detect hundreds of PII types across multiple languages and formats
        from ID numbers and phone numbers to bank accounts, emails, and IP
        addresses all in real time. We believe privacy protection should be
        simple, accurate, and accessible to any organization, regardless of
        size. That’s why we’ve built a platform that’s easy to integrate,
        scalable, and capable of adapting to different business environments.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        The journey of PII Detection App began in 2024 when a small team of
        software engineers, cybersecurity experts, and privacy advocates noticed
        a recurring problem: companies were unknowingly storing, sharing, or
        exposing PII without realizing it. Data breaches were on the rise, and
        compliance fines were skyrocketing under regulations like GDPR, CCPA,
        and Israel’s Privacy Protection Law. We decided to build a universal,
        AI-powered detection tool that could work in any environment from
        scanning incoming emails to auditing entire databases. Our mission was
        twofold: Provide high-accuracy PII detection that works in real time.
        Integrate seamlessly into existing workflows without slowing down
        productivity. Today, PII Detection App is trusted by organizations
        across multiple industries, helping them secure customer trust, avoid
        costly fines, and maintain the highest privacy standards.
